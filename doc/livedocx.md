# What Happened to LiveDocx?

In May 2016, Text Control GmbH [announced](https://www.textcontrol.com/blog/2016/05/25/) the successor to LiveDocx, called [ReportingCloud](https://www.reporting.cloud/). LiveDocx was shut down in May 2017.

With ReportingCloud, you can merge MS Word compatible templates with textual and image data via a Web API, to create customized invoices, contracts and quotations.
 
Unlike its predecessor, ReportingCloud offers a WYSIWYG online template designer, which you can use to create your templates.

The PHP SDK - which was authored and is supported by the project - gives you access to all ReportingCloud features, via an easy to understand API.

If you have used LiveDocx in the past, you will quickly be able to create professional looking documents in Adobe PDF, MS Word and HTML formats with ReportingCloud.
