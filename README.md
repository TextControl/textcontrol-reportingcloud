## Minimum Requirements

Since [ReportingCloud PHP SDK 3.0](/doc/release-3.0.0.md), the PHP SDK requires **PHP 7.4** or **PHP 8.0**.

All versions of PHPs prior to 7.3 have reached [end-of-life](http://php.net/eol.php) and consequently, no further security updates will be released for them. If your application is running in an older environment, it is highly advisable to update to a more current version of PHP.

If you are unable or unwilling to update your PHP installation, you may consider using ReportingCloud PHP SDK 2.0, which supports PHP 7.1, or ReportingCloud PHP SDK 1.0, which supports PHP 5.6. 

Please note, however, these versions are no longer maintained.

Alternatively, it is possible to use ReportingCloud by directly accessing the [Web API](https://docs.reporting.cloud/docs/endpoint). In such cases, it is advisable to use the [curl](http://php.net/manual/en/book.curl.php) extension to make the API calls.

## Install Using Composer

Install ReportingCloud PHP SDK 3.0 in your project using [Composer](http://getcomposer.org):

```bash
composer require textcontrol/txtextcontrol-reportingcloud:^3.0
```

After installing, you just need to include Composer's autoloader:

```php
include_once 'vendor/autoload.php';
```

You are now ready to use the SDK.

## API Key for Demos and Unit Tests

ReportingCloud PHP SDK ships with a number of sample applications (see directory `/demo`) and phpunit tests (see directory `/test`). The scripts in each of these directories require an [API key](https://docs.reporting.cloud/docs/chapter/introduction/apikey) for ReportingCloud in order to be executed. So that the API key is not made inadvertently publicly available via a public GIT repository, you will first need to specify it. There are two ways in which you can do this:

### Using PHP Constants:

```php
define('REPORTING_CLOUD_API_KEY', 'your-api-key');
```

### Using Environmental Variables (For Example in `.bashrc`)

```bash
export REPORTING_CLOUD_API_KEY='your-api-key'
```

Note, these instructions apply only to the demo scripts and phpunit tests. When you use ReportingCloud in your application, set the [API key](https://docs.reporting.cloud/docs/chapter/introduction/apikey) in your constructor or by using the `setApiKey($apiKey)` methods. For an example, see `/demo/instantiation.php`.

## Getting Started

The [PHP Quickstart Tutorial](https://docs.reporting.cloud/docs/chapter/quickstart/php) in the ReportingCloud [documentation](https://docs.reporting.cloud/) is your starting point to using ReportingCloud PHP SDK in your own applications.

In addition, ReportingCloud PHP SDK ships with a number of sample applications (see directory `/demo`). These samples applications, which are well commented, have been written to demonstrate all parts of ReportingCloud.

## Getting Support

The ReportingCloud PHP SDK is authored and supported by Text Control GmbH, the manufacturer of the ReportingCloud Web API.

Despite our best efforts to create understandable documentation, demo applications and unit tests, we understand that there are times when you may need some technical assistance.
